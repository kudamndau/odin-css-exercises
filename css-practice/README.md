In this directory you will find several files created with the aim to practice the CSS tricks that I am learning to help me retain the knowledge and solidify my expertise in applying different CSS rules to HTML elements according to best pratices.

3. Grouping Selectors
4. Chaining Selectors
5. Decendent Combinators
6. The Cascade

# NOTE:
> I have used comments to highlight and indicate what I have learnt and applied so be on the lookout for those. Moreover I will be adding notes in my wiki to explain a bit on each topic so that you know what to look for as well as to demonstarte my understanding of the topics I am learning.

> Please also check out my commit history as it is also a part of what I am learning plus it provides information on the work I am doing and the chronology sort of. 

> I am open to any form of feedback as this will help me improve my skills greatly, so should you identify any anomalies leave a comment or better yet fix it.
