      <h4>Beginning with the end in mind!</h4>
      <p>
        A few basic topics and barely a month into my official coding journey, my dream became pretty humongous... 
        I dreamt of going places, I dreamt of becoming a <strong>FAANG</strong> software developer. Now isn't that huge! 
        I mean those are pretty big shoes to fill and I probably wouldn't call you crazy for thinking that. 
        I pretty much still am just a biologist who knows a little bit of coding and apparently has a pocket full of dreams. 
        Ha ha ha! But guess what!? I am just so crazy enough to believe I can and I will make my dream come true. 
        I am as I speak right now visualising myself as a FAANGM (the M is for Microsoft) team member. 
        For me that's the endgame. Delusional? ...well, maybe from your perspective, but from mine, that's power, that's strength, 
        that's resilience, and it just might be grit.

      <h4>How it all began</h4>
      <p>
        So let me take you back to the beginning of this journey, maybe you just might end up believing with me that I am going to be a <strong>FAANGM</strong> team member after all.
        Just as a disclaimer, I am not trying to make you believe me or what I say. I am just writing code and sharing my story.
        If you end up believing me, well kudos to me for being a very great and convincing storyteller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ummm... Where was I? The beginning? of what? My story? which one? Oh yeah my coding journey, my bad hehehe. Well my journey started last year, 2023 in October.
        My partner and I had been working with a guy who was a friend at that time but no longer is (story for another day, don't ask me about it right now).
        We were working on establishing a business, had been at it for a couple of months actually. We then decided to have our website done and so we procured services 
        from a local web developer. When he finished with his work <strong>I</strong> inspected the work thoroughly and unfortunately the perfectionist in me 
        wasn't satisfied. I looked at the website and thought to myself <em>"nah this ain't good at all!"</em> It did't take me that long to make it known to my business counterparts.
        But as if that wasn't enough, the toxic trait in me just wouldn't let me end it at that. I just had to declare that I could do better than the web developer, imagine!
        I actually told everyone that I was going to make a better website than that, one that could <em>fully represent our brand well.</em> And that's how this journey to FAANGM-dom started.

      <p>
        So eversince then I have been learning on and off as a self-taught student, with the help of ChatGPT until recently when I enrolled into formal programmes, one of which is <strong>The Odin Project</strong>. 
        Well I have been doing my homework since and right now you're reading this crazy story because I just wanted to practice and show-off my CSS skills so far. 
        I know you know what I just did here; but I am tired and sleepy now. So goodnight, maybe if you ask me nicely tomorrow I might give you a part two. Otherwise thanks for reading don't forget to leave feadback in my repository, I am on Github.
